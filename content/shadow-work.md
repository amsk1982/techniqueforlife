##### One-to-one **_ShadowWork_ coaching**

What do you want to have happen in your life?  What's in the way?

Are you feeling stuck?  Is the same pattern showing up _again_?  Maybe it's because there's some aspect of you which is in shadow.  This is exactly what it sounds like - some side of ourselves which is partially or completely 'out of our sight', yet still having an effect.

> "_Bethan's facilitation...was excellent.  \[She\] was professional, friendly and created a safe space for us to work....already I am understanding myself and how I react to things much more clearly."_  Geraldine

##### **_Wholeness_ coaching**  _available online or in person_

I believe we all want to feel whole and when we don't, we find life difficult - and then some of us go searching.  I offer you support, encouragement and reflection for your process, drawing on my trainings and on years of experience of my own and others' journeys.

See me as your personal cheerleader, walking beside you as you move forwards, ready to lend a hand when needed or help you shine a light into dark corners of yourself, always on your side.

> _"Coaching calls with Bethan really helped me to move though some challenges and discomfort.  She is empathetic and kind enabling me to feel safe and able to share my deepest vulnerabilities without fear of judgement. And in doing so hugely fruitful gifts of insight and wisdom came both from myself and Bethan. Her ability to catalyse and reflect back important opportunities for learning, growth and a different perspective has been invaluable to me. I would really recommend working with Bethan if you have the opportunity." GR_

##### **Information:** coaching sessions

**First step:**  Whether you'd like sessions in person or online, I recommend we have direct contact first so you can meet me one-to-one and see if I feel like a good 'fit' for you.  To set up your free 20-minute video call you can call or [email](mailto:bethan@techniqueforlife.com) me.

**Before we begin:**  I ask you to provide me with some background information before we start (by email).

**In person:**  Sessions are held in or near Totnes, Devon (which has a [train station](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/TOT/details.html)).  It is possible for them to be further afield, by arrangement and for an extra fee.

For a first ShadowWork session we need to allow 3 hours, with the flexibility to continue for an extra half hour if needed.

This may be enough if you want to work on something quite specific.   If you'd like to unravel an issue more, or to have coaching as part of your ongoing development and support, further sessions can be arranged.

Whichever you choose, we have a 'phone call about 10 days later to check in and see how you are and address any questions arising.

**Online / ongoing coaching:**  The first session is usually for 1 hour, subsequently they can be of a length mutually agreed, minimum 1 hour.

**Finances:**  I work on a sliding scale basis* and ask you to communicate at the time of booking what you are able to pay.

For a ShadowWork first booking the scale is from £333 - £173

For a first 1-hour session the scale is from £97 - £67

Ongoing sessions are then £97 - £57

I offer a limited number of sessions each month on an agreed-donation basis to those who are unable to to pay the minimum rate.

The sliding scale!:  I realise that this is not the norm and that it therefore can feel uncomfortable - it's my attempt to meet the tension between the desire to make this work available for all who wish to engage and the desire to honour my skills, training, time etc.  And my goal in general is more to support you in looking at what may well be uncomfortable, in the process of which you expand, rather than to "make things nice" ie to make circumstances more comfortable, which can so often lead to contraction.
