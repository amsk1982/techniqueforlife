##### **_Wholeness_ coaching**

I believe we all want to feel whole, and when we don't, we find life difficult and some of us go searching.  In **_Wholeness coaching_** I offer support, encouragement and reflection for your process, drawing on my trainings and on experience of my own and others' journeys.

See me as your personal cheerleader, walking beside you as you move forwards, ready to lend a hand when needed or help you shine a light into dark corners of yourself, always on your side.

##### One-to-one **_ShadowWork_ coaching** is also now available.

When things in life seem to be stuck, or the same pattern is showing up over and over again, maybe it's because there's something in shadow.  This is exactly what it sounds like - some aspect of ourselves which is partially or completely out of our 'sight', yet operational none the less.

Contact me for a free call if you'd like to discuss how you might benefit.   bethan@techniqueforlife.com / 07515 482 426
