##### One-to-one **_ShadowWork_ coaching**

What do you want to have happen in your life?  What's in the way?

Are you feeling stuck?  Is the same pattern showing up _again_?  Maybe it's because there's some aspect of you which is in shadow.  This is exactly what it sounds like - some side of ourselves which is partially or completely 'out of our sight', yet still having an effect.

> "_Bethan's facilitation...was excellent.  \[She\] was professional, friendly and created a safe space for us to work....already I am understanding myself and how I react to things much more clearly."_  Geraldine

##### **_Wholeness_ coaching**  _available online or in person_

I believe we all want to feel whole and when we don't, we find life difficult - and then some of us go searching.  I offer you support, encouragement and reflection for your process, drawing on my trainings and on years of experience of my own and others' journeys.

See me as your personal cheerleader, walking beside you as you move forwards, ready to lend a hand when needed or help you shine a light into dark corners of yourself, always on your side.

> _"Coaching calls with Bethan really helped me to move though some challenges and discomfort.  She is empathetic and kind enabling me to feel safe and able to share my deepest vulnerabilities without fear of judgement. And in doing so hugely fruitful gifts of insight and wisdom came both from myself and Bethan. Her ability to catalyse and reflect back important opportunities for learning, growth and a different perspective has been invaluable to me. I would really recommend working with Bethan if you have the opportunity." GR_

The first session is between 3 - 5 hours, or it can be two 3-hour sessions.
