##### **_Wholeness_ coaching**

I believe we all want to feel whole and when we don't, we find life difficult - and then some of us go searching.  I offer you support, encouragement and reflection for your process, drawing on my trainings and on years of experience of my own and others' journeys.

See me as your personal cheerleader, walking beside you as you move forwards, ready to lend a hand when needed or help you shine a light into dark corners of yourself, always on your side.

##### One-to-one **_ShadowWork_ coaching**

When things in life seem to be stuck, or the same pattern is showing up over and over again, maybe it's because there's something in shadow.  This is exactly what it sounds like - some aspect of ourselves which is partially or completely out of our 'sight', yet operational none the less.
