Bethan offers School of Being workshops looking at relating & intimacy, 

one-to-one coaching based on _ShadowWork,_                                   and Alexander Technique sessions.

She has been working with groups since 2008 bringing compassion, empathy and the invitation to welcome yourself exactly as you are in each moment.

Her aim is to create an accepting, non-judgmental space for whatever arises.

After a first career in the helping professions she retrained as an Alexander Technique teacher and then in Shadow Work facilitation and with renowned relationship expert Jan Day's School of Being. She continues to study with Jan Day and with Joanna Watters ("Supporting a radical acceptance of present moment reality")
