Bethan offers **_Wholeness coaching_**, **_Shadow Work_** coaching,  
School of Being workshops on themes of _relating & intimacy_,  
and _Alexander Technique_ for individuals and groups.

She invites you to welcome yourself exactly as you are in each moment as a starting point for opening to your full self.  Her aim is to create an accepting, non-judgmental space for whatever arises.

##### About Bethan:-

During a first career in the helping professions Bethan was drawn to Alexander Technique and later to Shadow Work and Tantra, all of which helped her deal with personal challenges such as bereavement, depression and a sense of not belonging.

Over time she has trained and practiced as an Alexander Technique teacher, a Shadow Work coach and with renowned relationship expert Jan Day in her School of Being.  
She continues to study with Jan Day and with Joanna Watters ("Supporting a radical acceptance of present moment reality")
