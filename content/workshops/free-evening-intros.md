Each session will stand alone; you’re welcome to attend either.

Feel free to contact me with any questions

Please arrive five minutes early (7.25pm) as the room size limits numbers.

To care for all, please only attend if you are free of coldy / covid-19 symptoms and have not been in contact in the previous 10 days with anyone who’s tested positive or is showing symptoms. You are welcome to wear a mask if you wish, however it will not be possible to maintain 1m distance from everyone else due to the size of the venue. **Bring warm layers, blankets** etc if you feel the cold as we will have ventilation!

Please book a place (follow the link in blue) to attend online and you'll be sent the Zoom link shortly before.  Once we have begun at 7.30 it will not be possible to join, so please be sure to log on in time!

I suggest you join the call where you will have privacy, if this is not going to be possible please use headphone etc to ensure that the call can't be overheard by anyone around you.
