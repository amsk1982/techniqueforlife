#### Free evening introduction to Shadow Work

7\.30 - 9.00pm

upstairs at [Ola Clinic](http://www.totneschiropractic.co.uk/), 5a Fore Street, Totnes TQ9 5DA

These evenings offer an exploratory ‘toe in the water’ with no obligation - come along and find out a bit more about yourself, ask questions, meet me!

Each session will stand alone; you’re welcome to attend any of them.

Please arrive five minutes early (7.25pm) as the room size limits numbers.

Feel free to contact me with any questions

_Covid-19 precautions etc:_ To care for all, please only attend if you are free of coldy / covid-19 symptoms and have not been in contact in the previous 10 days with anyone who’s tested positive or is showing symptoms. You are welcome to wear a mask if you wish, however it will not be possible to maintain 1m distance from all others due to the size of the venue. **Bring warm layers, blankets** etc if you feel the cold as we will have ventilation!
