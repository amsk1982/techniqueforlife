#### We're still bringing you "Meetings Without Masks" \~ now it's online.

[Click here for tickets](https://buytickets.at/bethanevans) for events with me & Ed, we run them alternately with our colleagues and friends Nicola & Jason

* _Feeling starved of meaningful contact...?_
* _Just starting to feel ready to date again....?_
* _Daunted because it looks like there may not be many opportunities to meet new people?_

In this time of limited contact our deep needs for love, support and safety are crying out to be met, now more than ever.

When dating we often put pressure on ourselves to be accepted & liked. Pressure to impress, to be physically attractive, to be funny or talkative. What if you could drop all that and learn to show up just as you are, to be loved and accepted for that?

Meetings without Masks Online is a workshop that enables you to meet interesting, kind, fun people from a place of honesty. We create a place to explore connection, with structures and guidance designed to allow openness, truth and trust.

It is based on the Meetings without Masks day workshop created by relationship expert Jan Day, which we run regularly - admittedly, usually in person!

If you or someone you know would like to hear us talk a bit about it, we did a facebook live - ["What is Meetings Without Masks Online?"](https://TechniqueForLife.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=132947c457b186b9c745b3be4&id=c88fdc03dc&e=66a7344f19)

and there's a short FAQ-type conversation with Kenny Marmarella d'Cruz here: [mwm-short-chat-kmdc_trim001.mp4](/uploads/mwm-short-chat-kmdc_trim001.mp4 "Kenny Marmarella d'Cruz")

**Meet the team**:-

Here's a link to [Ed's website](https://www.edrooke.com/); I run 'Meetings' with Ed online and, when possible, in person.

As do [Nicola](https://nicolafostercoaching.com/) & Jason -a couple who are dear friends and colleagues of ours.

And of course there's the woman who devised the original workshop: [Jan Day](http://janday.com/) and her husband Frieder Fischer
