#### Meetings Without Masks Online

* _Already feeling starved of meaningful contact...?_ 
* _Just starting to feel ready to date again....?_ 
* _Daunted because looks like there may not be opportunities to meet new people for the foreseeable future?_    

  We're still bringing you some of the "Meetings Without Masks" magic, only now it's online.

_Saturday 25th April at 6.45pm we're doing a facebook live: "What is Meetings Without Masks Online?"_

In this time of isolation our deep needs for love, support and safety are crying out to be met, now more than ever.

When dating we often put pressure on ourselves to be accepted & liked. Pressure to impress, to be physically attractive, to be funny or talkative. What if you could drop all that and learn to show up just as you are, to be loved and accepted for that?   
   
 Meetings without Masks Online is a workshop that enables you to meet interesting, kind, fun people from a place of honesty. We create a place to explore connection, with structures and guidance designed to allow openness, truth and trust.

It is based on the Meetings without Masks day workshop created by relationship expert Jan Day, which we run regularly - admittedly, usually in person!
