#### Emergence \~ Transitioning from Restriction to Renewal

Join us as we mindfully emerge from lockdown restrictions, honour the enormity of the last fifteen months and celebrate the coming of summer. You will have the opportunity to:

* Shake off lockdown fatigue and integrate lockdown learnings
* Deepen your connection with yourself, each other and nature
* Play in solo time, facilitated practices and held group processes
* Access your authentic needs and responses to this unique time
* Release into connection and holding in an intimate group (max 12)
* Be nourished by hearty food, folk and vibrant surroundings
* Come away relaxed, renewed and re-oriented

You will experience an inclusive, immersive workshop enabling you to encounter yourself and your questions about what's being asked of us in this mercurial moment, all within the sweet holding of The Hearth's natural surroundings, featuring:

* nature immersion in a lovingly stewarded, semi-wilded valley
* nature-based mindfulness exercises & practices
* skilled therapeutic holding from experienced facilitators
* exploring your relationship to _this_ moment
* nourishing, organic, locally sourced, plant-based food provided
* camping with hot outdoor showers and optional glamping upgrade
* inspiration from ecopsychology principles, Joanna Macy’s “Work that Reconnects” and Bill Plotkin’s Nature-based Map of the Human Psyche

The weekend will be COVID-safe with physical distancing measures in place. All group facilities are outdoors or in open-sided shelter. If you have any concerns please discuss with us.

**Basic Information** (further details below)**:**

* Venue: [The Hearth Retreat](https://www.thehearthdevon.com/)
* Accommodation: camping or glamping
* Delicious organic, plant-based food and hot drinks provided
* Facilitators: Bethan Evans and Freddy Weaver

**VENUE**: A sixteen acre sanctuary in south Devon, 15mins drive from Totnes (mainline rail station direct from London and Bristol) and 10mins drive from the A38, for those driving. The site is based around an old disused quarry which provides the slate-hewn shelter of the Hearthside, and a steep and wooded valley with a stream running through the land. Group sessions will be held outdoors in the Hearthside space and the woods, and if rainy there’s an atmospheric old barn in which to shelter and share. The land is gratefully stewarded by Helena and Freddy Weaver and their growing family, with support from Devon Wildlife Trust to welcome and expand biodiversity.

> _“Whether you want to go for sunlight dappled walks in woodlands, or lie in grass meadows looking at the stars The Hearth is a place where time slows down and you can just simply enjoy.” Tom_

> _“The environment is spectacular creating the most restful of spaces, to think, to be, to rejuvenate and remember we are nature.” Ali_

**ACCOMMODATION**:

**Camping**: Your spacious camping pitch with lovely views and hot outdoor showers is included in the retreat cost.

**Glamping**: There are two further accommodation options – the Wildflower Cabin and Apple Wagon. They are both lovingly curated, handcrafted spaces that are designed to maximise sun, light and seclusion. For the retreat they will be as advertised on the Airbnb pages (link below) but sharing showers and compost loos with other retreatants. They are therefore being offered at reduced prices so if you would like a bit more comfort then get in touch directly to book either space when purchasing your retreat \~ contact@thehearthdevon.com

**FOOD**: we believe that on retreat you can better soak up the good stuff when released from everyday practicalities. So come and be nourished with delicious, organic, plant-based food cooked by an excellent local chef.

We will provide breakfast, lunch and dinner, with gluten (and dairy) free options. Sadly we can’t cater for any further restrictions, but do feel free to bring your own food should you need. There will be fridge, freezer and simple gas hob access. We advise bringing a few of your own snacks too, if you’d like to follow your own appetite’s timing.

Herbal teas, “normal teas” and coffee will be available on tap.
