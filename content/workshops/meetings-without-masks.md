* Are you looking for love, connection, intimacy and relationship?
* Are you finding it hard to meet the right person?
* Have you tried the Internet, speed dating or the singles scene and felt it ring a bit hollow? Are you looking for more but not quite sure how to find it?

It can be tough to make real connections in our busy lives. Pubs, clubs and the dating industry can feel like a market place.

So where and how do we find and meet each other in a different way?

MEETINGS WITHOUT MASKS is the answer.

Here's what people have said about their "Meetings without Masks"

_"I really enjoyed the day on Sunday and got a lot from the work. I felt it was well led, safe and rewarding. I will definitely recommend to friends_..."   Owen

_“I really enjoyed the whole day, discovering what is true for me in relationship to myself and others. Thank you.”_ Elizabeth

_“For me, this is an interactive, skilfully held event for single people rather than a dating event so there is no pressure and, probably, because of this I was relaxed and made some good connections.”_ Adrian

_“This workshop has really helped me see & experience how to approach relationships in a way that will probably serve me and the other.”_ Jonathan

_“A beautifully held space for connections to emerge. Simple exercises which bring awareness to what’s important to me when connecting with others.”_ Anon.

<div>This wonderful event has been specifically designed and developed to provide a very different kind of experience for people who are looking for love and partnership.</div>

<div>In a gender-balanced group, we will explore how to meet each other more authentically. The day has been carefully structured to help this happen, with fun and creative exercises to open and relax you. Devised by coach and relationship expert, Jan Day, it is safe, supportive and both professionally and compassionately delivered: </div>

<div>A singles event that includes mind, body, heart and soul, alongside humor and tenderness, dancing and laughter.</div>

<div>Whether you meet your soul mate or not, it is a great opportunity to enjoy, and maybe risk, being a little (or a lot!) more intimate and human and alive.</div>
