\~ Do you feel like you need some time for yourself?

\~ Do you want a break from the daily grind?

\~ Are you feeling frayed?... frustration?... boredom?...  grieving?...  feeling a lot?... feeling numb?  Bring it all.

Come and join me and my dear friend and colleague Melanie Ward

as we hold the circles for women to drop, to share, to just BE.  Evenings of resourcing & nourishment, time just for you.

[Melanie](https://www.melanieward.co.uk/about-melanie) and I have known each other for years -we are in a shared women's circle and have both completed the Women In Power programme.  We bring our sensitivity, compassion and acceptance as well as our many years of experience in Shadow Work, intimacy & relating 'work' and hands-on (Alexander Technique in my case, and Melanie is a shiatsu practitioner)
