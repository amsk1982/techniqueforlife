Living Tantra is a series of sexuality and intimacy workshops that begins with Living Tantra 1. It offers an opportunity to explore more deeply into the realms of ecstatic loving, sexual intimacy and sacred union so that you can learn to have healthy, satisfying relationships.

Because of the nature of this work, a pre-requisite for the Living Tantra course is the foundational workshop, Living Tantra 1. When you have completed the full 7 days of Living Tantra 1, you can participate in any of the other Living Tantra workshops and you can also join the 18 month Living Tantra Training group if you wish.

The aim of Living Tantra is to give you a space where you can learn and grow into celebrating your natural, healthy sexuality with ease, playfulness, tenderness, consciousness, integrity and joy.

Living Tantra is for people who want to experience richer relationships, deeper intimacy and more authentic connection with others. Living Tantra is a carefully structured seven day residential workshop which includes guided meditations, explorations in small groups and sharing circles. Many of these explorations involve dance and touch, two simple actions which can encourage all that is within to be held with consciousness and compassion. You will also be introduced to ritual and ceremony, to breath work and the body's natural sources of energy. This workshop invites participants into expansion of the heart, mind and body.

The workshop will focus on the ways that we love, relate and express our sexuality as man or woman. It aims to open participants to a deeper 'yes' to all that they are. In the process, you will discover the potential for ease, delight, playfulness and consciousness. You will meet others in a caring and respectful environment and you will be encouraged to awaken a more spiritual connection with your sexuality. You will learn to discover your desires and how to express them openly, with care and respect. You will learn to love and honour yourself and your sexual nature as a man or woman and to celebrate your sensitivity, sensuality and innocence. Throughout Living Tantra your willingness to be alive and present with your core emotions is always encouraged. Explorations that focus on discovering and expressing your personal boundaries are an integral part of Living Tantra.

The Living Tantra series of workshops can either be taken individually or as part of an extended training course of personal growth. The benefits you can get from this workshop are:

* A sense of ease in your male/female body
* Increased self-confidence
* Renewed vitality
* A way of growing and healing your sexuality
* A consciousness and connection with spirit
* Learning to communicate your boundaries, desires and needs
* Moving towards rich, pleasurable relationships and heart-centred sexual relationships
* Experiencing yourself as a vibrantly alive man or woman
* Learning that you are strong enough to hold all you feel
* Allowing yourself to be tender and vulnerable
* Living with passion and love

Living Tantra gives your permission to enjoy pleasure. It also gives you the permission to say 'no'. The workshop invites you to connect with truth and love, to discover and integrate your masculine and feminine selves. This workshop will bring new experiences, new practices and ideas and a greater clarity of thought to anyone consciously seeing personal growth in this area of the human psyche - sexuality. Allow your spirit to connect with your body, give yourself a truly holistic experience which can set the tone and pace of your future sexual self!
